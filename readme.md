# How We See Art

Have you ever stopped to think about how art changes over time?
The intriguing shift from classical masterpieces in the 15th century to the avant-garde expressions of pop arts in the 20th century?
Inspired by my personal fascination with art history, I embarked on a journey through time, and analyzed artworks comprehensively from 15th century to the 20the century, using the Met (the Metropolitan Museum of Art) API.

The color palettes used in artworks from the 15th century predominantly consisted of earthy tones, reflecting the prevalent artistic styles and pigment materials of the time. Shades of browns and muted tones were commonly observed, indicative of the natural pigments available during that era. In contrast, artworks from the 20th century exhibited a more diverse and vibrant range of colors compared to their 15th-century counterparts.
